# Data Sourcing

The dataset was provided by Mo Chen on his YouTube channel, and I truly appreciate the valuable guidance he offered throughout this project.


# Data Cleaning and Transformation

1. The process started with organizing the data by converting the various sheets into "Tables" for easier management. From there, the data was explored to identify any potential quality issues.

2. This involved checking for NULL values, empty fields, and errors, as well as removing duplicates and unnecessary columns. I ensured that the data remained consistent and clean, focusing on data types, formats, and the accuracy of values.

3. To enrich the dataset, I used the XLOOKUP function to retrieve customer details such as name, email, country, coffee type, roast type, size, unit price, and loyalty card information from the customers and products tables. Additionally, I created a "Sales" column through calculations, while "Coffee Type Name" and "Roast Type Name" columns were generated using the IF function.


# Data Analysis

Three pivot tables were generated to summarize the data and highlight key trends. These tables focused on analyzing the relationship between sales and various factors such as date, customer details, and country, making it easier to spot patterns and insights within the dataset.


# Data Visualization

The dashboard was built by inserting and customizing pivot charts from the relevant pivot tables on a dedicated sheet called "Dashboard." To enhance user experience and interactivity, three "Slicers" and a "Timeline" were included.

Hereâ€™s a preview of the final Excel dashboard below.
